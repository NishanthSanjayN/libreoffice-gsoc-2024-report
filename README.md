## Overview

LibreOffice is a free and powerful office suite, and a successor to OpenOffice.org (commonly known as OpenOffice).
Its clean interface and feature-rich tools help you unleash your creativity and enhance your productivity.

## Project

The goal of this project is to enhance the LibreOffice Writer by implementing a comments sidebar feature.
Currently, comments are displayed at document margin, which can be cumbersome and disrupt the userâ€™s workflow.
By adding the comment section in the sidebar, the aim is to improve usability, streamline the commenting process, and enhance collaboration within the application.
